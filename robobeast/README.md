# RoboBeast 3D Printer Configuration Files

This folder contains all the configuration files, firmware, and profiles needed to set up and operate the RoboBeast 3D printer.

## 📋 Contents

### Configuration Files

- **`config`** - Main Smoothieboard configuration file
  - Contains all printer parameters including steps per mm, acceleration, feed rates, stepper configuration, thermistor settings, and motion control parameters
  - This is the primary configuration file loaded by the Smoothieboard on boot
  - Edit this file to change printer behavior and calibration settings

- **`config-override`** - Runtime configuration overrides
  - Generated automatically by M-codes sent during operation (M92, M203, M204, M205, M206, M907, etc.)
  - Stores values like steps per unit, acceleration, junction deviation, motor currents, home offsets, and extruder settings
  - These settings override values in the main `config` file
  - ⚠️ **DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY** - Use G-code commands to modify these settings

- **`grid25`** - Bed leveling calibration data
  - Contains Z-offset measurements from automatic bed leveling probe
  - Generated by running the bed leveling routine (G29 or G32)
  - 25 data points representing the height map of the print bed
  - Used for automatic mesh bed leveling compensation during prints

### Firmware

- **`FIRMWARE.CUR`** - Current Smoothieboard firmware binary
  - The active firmware running on the Smoothieboard controller
  - To update: copy a new firmware file to the SD card and reset the board
  - The file will be renamed to `FIRMWARE.CUR` after successful flash

### Slicer Profile

- **`beast profile.3mf`** - CURA slicer profile for RoboBeast
  - Pre-configured CURA settings optimized for the RoboBeast printer
  - Includes bed size, nozzle diameter, print speeds, temperatures, and other slicing parameters
  - Import this into CURA to get started quickly

## 🚀 Getting Started

### First Time Setup
If you're setting up the RoboBeast printer for the first time, please see **[INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md)** for:
- Software installation (CURA and Pronterface)
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Common troubleshooting tips
- Connection and configuration guides

### Ready to Print?
Once your printer is set up, see **[PRINTING.md](PRINTING.md)** for complete printing instructions:
- Slicing models in CURA
- Transferring G-code to SD card (recommended for long prints)
- Starting and monitoring prints
- Print quality troubleshooting
- Maintenance tips

## 🔧 Configuration Workflow (Advanced)

### Initial Setup
1. Copy `config` to your Smoothieboard SD card
2. The `config-override` will be generated automatically
3. Import `beast profile.3mf` into CURA

### Bed Leveling
1. Run bed leveling calibration (G29 or G32)
2. The `grid25` file will be generated/updated automatically
3. Enable bed leveling in your start G-code with appropriate commands

### Making Changes
- **Hardware changes** (steps/mm, max speeds, etc.): Edit `config` file directly
- **Calibration changes** (home offset, motor currents, etc.): Use G-code commands (M206, M907, etc.)
- **Slicer settings**: Adjust in CURA and re-export profile if needed

- **Smoothieware Documentation:** [http://smoothieware.org/](http://smoothieware.org/)
- **Config File Reference:** [http://smoothieware.org/configuring-smoothie](http://smoothieware.org/configuring-smoothie)
- **G-code Reference:** [http://smoothieware.org/supported-g-codes](http://smoothieware.org/supported-g-codes)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Always backup your configuration files before making changes
- The `config-override` file should not be edited manually - use M-codes instead
- After modifying the `config` file, restart the Smoothieboard or send M999
- Keep the `grid25` file updated by running bed leveling calibration periodically
- When sharing configurations, include both `config` and `config-override` files
